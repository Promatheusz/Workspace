# ðŸ“’ Notes Workspace  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
In the **AI-driven world**, taking random notes is **pointless** if they donâ€™t provide **real value** later.  
The goal is to document **only what matters**â€”fundamentals, key insights, and reusable knowledge.   

### âœ… Goals:  
- Focus on **useful, future-proof** documentation.  
- Capture **essential knowledge** that can be applied later.  
- Avoid **unnecessary clutter**â€”keep notes concise and actionable.
